The knowledge of melting mechanisms is thus based mainly on the results of theoretical predictions. This work reports on the investigation of ultrafast melting of thin polycrystalline Pd films studied by optical laser pump – X-ray free-electron laser probe experiments and molecular-dynamics simulations. By acquiring X-ray diffraction snapshots with sub-picosecond resolution, we capture the sample’s atomic structure during its transition from the crystalline to the liquid state. Bridging the timescales of experiments and simulations allows us to formulate a realistic microscopic picture of the crystal-liquid transition. According to the experimental data, the melting process gradually accelerates with the increasing density of deposited energy. The molecular dynamics simulations reveal that the transition mechanism progressively varies from heterogeneous,\ninitiated inside the material at structurally disordered grain boundaries, to homogenous, proceeding catastrophically in the crystal volume on a picosecond timescale comparable to that of electron-phonon coupling. We demonstrate that the existing models of strongly non-equilibrium melting, developed for systems with relatively weak electron-phonon coupling, remain valid even for ultrafast heating rates achieved in femtosecond laserexcited Pd. Furthermore, we highlight the role of pre-existing and transiently generated crystal defects in the transition to the liquid state.",

      "abstractnote": "Hydrogen generation by photoreforming of methanol is being one of the most intensely investigated photochemical transformations in pursuing a sustainable, zero waste circular economy. This transformation usually produces a significant amount of gaseous carbon in the form of CO2 and CO that disqualifies many active photocatalysts as being fully sustainable. Here, we demonstrate the atomically dispersed Cu on TiO2 composite nanoparticles synthesized by the wet impregnation method that are highly active and selective in hydrogen production by photoreforming of methanol solution. Our photocatalyst exhibits an apparent quantum efficiency of 10% at 365 nm wavelength and the low power 0.45 W light emitting diode (LED) source. The only gaseous product found is molecular hydrogen, whereas all carbon is trapped in the downstream liquid mixture of formaldehyde and formic acid, making the process fully sustainable and clean. We used various experimental techniques and density functional theory calculations (DFT) to characterize our photocatalysts and provide an insight into the exceptional behavior of the Cu/TiO2 system. A combination of ab initio DFT and X–ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements allowed us to identify the Cu+–Cu0–Cu+ redox cycle under the reaction conditions. Bypassing the Cu2+ oxidation state is crucial to keep the oxidation potential of photogenerated holes low enough to prevent CO2 generation and keeping all carbon in the liquid phase. This work paves the way toward an efficient and clean generation of hydrogen by photoreforming of methanol over well–established and cheap Cu/TiO2 photocatalyst.",

In this work, we probe the atomic arrangement of Ce55Al45 and Ce75Al25 glasses by X-ray absorption spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction in the pressure range of 0–30 GPa. The pressure-dependent parameters of local environment of cerium atoms are evaluated by extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) fitting. We demonstrate that due to compositional dependence of stiffness of Ce-Al pairs, densification of Ce55Al45 is accompanied by an increase of atomic size mismatch between Ce and Al stabilizing the amorphous phase, while a decrease of the mismatch is observed in Ce75Al25 alloy which eventually leads to its devitrification at 25 GPa.",

To reveal the microscopic details of stress accommodation mechanism, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the HP atomic arrangement. By comparing the experimental and the calculated Zr and Cu K-edge EXAFS signal we prove the realistic character of the computer simulations. A detailed geometrical analysis of the simulated atomic configurations shows that with increasing hydrostatic pressure the local structure of Zr–Cu amorphous alloy becomes gradually dominated by Cu-centred icosahedral structural motifs involving fivefold symmetry incompatible with crystalline ordering. The variation of the short-range order is attributed to preferential straining of mechanically soft bonds between zirconium atoms",

      "abstractnote": "Amorphous metallic alloys, also known as metallic glasses (MGs), are materials with unique physical properties resulting from their disordered yet densely packed atomic structure. The packing density of MGs can be further enhanced by external pressure, forcing the decrease of interatomic distances and modifying both the atomic and electronic structure of an alloy. This work reports on classical molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) studies of Ni64Zr36 MG in a hydrostatic pressure range of 0-120 GPa. The MD simulations revealed that compression leads to enhanced short-range ordering by increasing the contribution of efficiently packed icosahedral-like clusters. According to the DFT calculations, for pressure above 50 GPa, Zr atoms show a significant change in electronic configuration, with a dominant charge transfer from their s and p to d-states and charge redistribution between Ni and Zr atoms. This variation is correlated with the appearance of pairs with significantly shortened interatomic distances, as detected by the MD. We conclude that the enhanced icosahedral ordering in Ni64Zr36 MG is induced not only by the pressure-driven densification of an alloy but also by a variation of its electronic structure.",

      "abstractnote": "Due to its extremely short timescale, the non-equilibrium melting of metals is exceptionally difficult to probe\nexperimentally. The knowledge of melting mechanisms is thus based mainly on the results of theoretical predictions. This work reports on the investigation of ultrafast melting of thin polycrystalline Pd films studied by optical laser pump – X-ray free-electron laser probe experiments and molecular-dynamics simulations. By acquiring X-ray diffraction snapshots with sub-picosecond resolution, we capture the sample’s atomic structure during its transition from the crystalline to the liquid state. Bridging the timescales of experiments and simulations allows us to formulate a realistic microscopic picture of the crystal-liquid transition. According to the\nexperimental data, the melting process gradually accelerates with the increasing density of deposited energy. The\nmolecular dynamics simulations reveal that the transition mechanism progressively varies from heterogeneous,\ninitiated inside the material at structurally disordered grain boundaries, to homogenous, proceeding catastrophically in the crystal volume on a picosecond timescale comparable to that of electron-phonon coupling. We demonstrate that the existing models of strongly non-equilibrium melting, developed for systems with relatively weak electron-phonon coupling, remain valid even for ultrafast heating rates achieved in femtosecond laserexcited Pd. Furthermore, we highlight the role of pre-existing and transiently generated crystal defects in the\ntransition to the liquid state.",
