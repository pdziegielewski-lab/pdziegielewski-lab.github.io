 abstractnote = {n this work, we use extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) data collected using nano-polycrystalline diamond anvil cell to study the atomic arrangement in Zr–Cu metallic glass in high pressure (HP) conditions. To reveal the microscopic details of stress accommodation mechanism, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of the HP atomic arrangement. By comparing the experimental and the calculated Zr and Cu K-edge EXAFS signal we prove the realistic character of the computer simulations. A detailed geometrical analysis of the simulated atomic configurations shows that with increasing hydrostatic pressure the local structure of Zr–Cu amorphous alloy becomes gradually dominated by Cu-centred icosahedral structural motifs involving fivefold symmetry incompatible with crystalline ordering. The variation of the short-range order is attributed to preferential straining of mechanically soft bonds between zirconium atoms},
